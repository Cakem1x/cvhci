CVHCI Competition
===========================
This is just a small repo to organize my code for the CVHCI Competition. It consists of some assignments listed below.

Most of the code was already provided by the organizer of the Competition.

Assignment 1
----------------------------

This assignment consists of developing a color-based skin classifier.
To compile, just use the Makefile by typing make in one of the assignment directories.
Example usage would be something like ./assignment1 --gui.
The code expects a train and a test directory where it runs filled with images for training or testing. (or give a custom path via --path)
